*A real life exemple*

This is the code and some personal notes from the https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKaCCYZYBWo[Shapeless? - Easy!] talk where https://twitter.com/valentinkasas[Valentin Kasas] explains in a great way an advanced example of a real life use case (with https://gist.github.com/vil1/29f2d155679c703edfbe402f067962f6[slides]).

== Computing deltas

* Imagine we want to be able to determine what are the difference between two objects of the same type
* For example, we need to know what have changed in our DB since the last backup
* We need to be able to compute such deltas over a wide variety of classes, that are unrelated
* Of course, doing this by hand for each and every class is not an option

Our diff representation
[Source, java]
----
sealed trait Diff[A]
final case class Identical[A](value: A) extends Diff[A]
final case class Different[A](left: A, right: A) extends Diff[A]
object Diff {
def apply[A](left: A, right: A): Diff[A] =
  if (left == right) Identical(left)
  else       Different(left, right)
  }

*A first Delta implementation*

We are creating a superclass here using DepFn . The return type differs according to the input type
[source, scala]
----
trait SimpleDelta[R <: HList] extends DepFn2[R, R] {
  type Out <: HList //Result is bounded by HList
  }
  object SimpleDelta {
 /** type alias Aux adds as a type parameter the return Type. 
   * It is convenient in order to constrain it 
   * by passing it as a type parameter.
   */
type Aux[I <: HList, O <: HList] = SimpleDelta[I]{ type Out = O }
//Recursive Algorithm
implicit def hnilDelta: Aux[HNil, HNil] = new SimpleDelta[HNil] {
type Out = HNil
def apply(l: HNil, r: HNil): Out = HNil
}
implicit def hconsDelta[H, T <: HList, DT <: HList]
(implicit tailDelta: Aux[T, DT]) : Aux[H::T, Diff[H] :: DT] =
new SimpleDelta[H :: T]{
type Out = Diff[H] :: DT
def apply(l: H :: T, r: H :: T) : Out =
Diff(l.head, r.head) :: tailDelta(l.tail, r.tail)
}
def apply[A, R <: HList](l: A, r: A)
(implicit genA: Generic.Aux[A, R],
delta: SimpleDelta[R]): delta.Out =
delta(genA.to(l), genA.to(r))
}
