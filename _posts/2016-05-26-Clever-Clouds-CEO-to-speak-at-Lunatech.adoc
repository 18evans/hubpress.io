Clever Cloud is a “Europe-based PaaS company” that helps “developers deploy and run their apps with bulletproof infrastructure, automatic scaling, fair pricing” and aims “to make an easy-to-use service, without any vendor lock-in”.

Due to his experience at Clever Cloud — where he can work a wide range of technologies and tools — he has a lot of knowledge and is able to speak about many different subjects. He regularly speaks at various tech conferences.

We are opening up the presentation to everyone. Feel free to join us at 16:00.
