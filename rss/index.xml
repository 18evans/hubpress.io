<p>Functional Rotterdam is a meetup held monthly in our Lunatech office about Programming Languages, Scala, Computer programming, Haskell, Functional Programming and Clojure, organized by Vijay Kiran, Development Manager at Lunatech.  Thomas Meijers, Software Engineer at Lunatech, presented Free of Interpretation. The presentation was filmed by Celeste Franco (thanks!!).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of Scala&#8217;s main selling points is its interoperability with Java.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, this double-edged sword can be problematic, once you turned into a "functional programmer fundamentalist". This paradigms can make your program not only less beautiful but also harder to understand and reason about. How can we wrap Java libraries in a way that we can still enjoy all the benefits of pure functional programming?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This talk introduces the concept of the Free Monad, a powerful technic to separate parts of your program into data, its interpretation and the execution. As shown in this talk, this separation will give many benefits for testing and reasoning. As a use case we will rebuild a small part of a library created by the speaker, which wraps the OrientDB Java library. At the end of this talk you will be able to apply the concept of the Free Monad to wrap any Java Library into a pure functional one.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From the Spanish good weather to the Dutch every-possible-weather-in-one-day, from Waterfall to Agile, from just testing to property based testing. The path I took when joining Lunatech was an interesting one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I want to share some of that and show how my journey to <a href="https://gist.github.com/mariadroman/816d5b6848592aaacfa722c372dbccba">ScalaCheck</a> started. I will prove that it&#8217;s not complicated to start with and it can uncover deeply hidden bugs in your code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As developers, we need to be sure that we create code that performs exactly how it is meant to. This should be true in every possible scenario. However, how can we prove that our codebase actually does this for a wide range of data? Sometimes it is just not feasible to write innumerable amount of test cases for a specific function. We need to find a way to somehow prove our function works as expected in every possible case.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Property-based testing provides another way of thinking, that was new to me, about writing tests. Sometimes it is better to prove that a function satisfies a specific property, rather than to write a number of tests which try to confirm it is working fine. One way of proving is to generate an appropriate amount of data and apply these data to your test suite. These generated data should all have the same specific property, hence the name property-based testing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an example, imagine we want to test String concatenation. To do this we need to be sure that: <strong>For all given two strings, str1 and str2, the result of concatenating both strings must satisfy: str1.length + str2.length &gt;= str1.length</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Traditionally, we would write a test like:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala">test("Concatenate should generate a String of length s1+s2") {
concatenate("", "").length == 0
concatenate("Hello, ", "world.").length == 13 //Hello, world.    concatenate("Welcome to ","Lunatech.").length == 20
//Welcome to Lunatech.
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But testing all possible combinations of 2 strings is impractical this way. In these cases, ScalaCheck is the recommended solution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s first understand the basic concepts in ScalaCheck: Properties and Generators.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_properties">Properties</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In ScalaCheck you can specify what the input parameters are and what their properties are that must be satisfied by the input. It uses a very elegant and intuitive way for defining properties:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala">property(
"Concatenation length of two strings should be greater or equal to length of first string"
)
= forAll { (s1: String, s2: String) =&gt;
   (s1 + s2).length &gt;= s1.length
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this small piece of code, we declare a property ("Concatenation length of two strings &#8230;&#8203;"), that holds forAll possible cases of concatenating 2 strings (s1 and s2). This seems reasonable but how can we prove what this property holds true. One way is by creating a lot of tests. And that is where Generators come in handy.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_generators">Generators</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To generate this input data, ScalaCheck provides us with a wide range of generators available in objects Arbitraty and Gen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The org.scalacheck.Arbitrary module defines implicit Arbitrary instances for common types, for convenient use in your properties and generators:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>returns an arbitrary generator for the type T</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The org.scalacheck.Gen uses Arbitrary and offers various generators:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>alphaLowerChar, alphaUpperChar, alphaNumChar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identifier, alphaStr, numStr</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>negNum, posNum, chooseNum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>listOf, listOfN, nonEmptyListOf</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>choose, oneOf, someOf</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>const</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some examples using arbitrary/generators:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>id &#8592; arbitrary[Int]</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>married &#8592; arbitrary[Boolean]</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>age &#8592; choose(0, 120)</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>currency &#8592; const("euro")</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>description &#8592; arbitrary[String]</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, most of the time we do not want to check such a general data type. For this, ScalaCheck also offers the possibility of defining <strong>custom generators</strong> where we can establish what the input data should look like.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s use a simple example to understand the usage of custom generators. Imagine we are a Benelux bank that wants to verify that their Dutch customers who have a negative balance in at least one of their accounts, should be notified by email. For simplicity, we define customer and bank account as below:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>case class Account(accountId: String, balance: Double, country: String)
case class Customer(customerId: String, name: String, nationality: String, accounts: Seq[Account])</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So first we want to generate Account data. To do this, we make use of Arbitrary and Gen. Because we are only interested in Benelux accounts the country field will be one of "BE", "NL" or "LU"</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala"> // Account generator - only Benelux accounts
val genAccount = for {
accountId &lt;- Gen.identifier
balance &lt;- arbitrary[Double]
country &lt;- Gen.oneOf("NL", "BE", "LU")} yield Account(accountId, balance, country)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a next step, we generate customer data. Because we are only interested in Dutch clients the nationality of the customers will be forced to be always "NL"</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala">// Forcing customers to be Dutch will be as easy as:
val genDutchCustomer = for {
customerId &lt;- Gen.identifier
name &lt;- arbitrary[String].suchThat(_.nonEmpty)
nationality &lt;- Gen.const("NL")
accounts &lt;- nonEmptyListOf(genAccount)} yield Customer(customerId, name, nationality, accounts)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, from the Dutch customers, we are interested on those having at least one account with negative balance</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala">// Forcing customer to be Dutch and having negative balance:
val genDutchInRed = for {
customer &lt;- genDutchCustomer.suchThat(_.accounts.exists(_.balance &lt; 0))
} yield customer</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Something which is worth mentioning at this point is the usage of .suchThat. It is recommended not to write very restrictive conditions in this filter, because ScalaCheck first generates all input data, and filters it later based on the condition provided. If the condition is too restrictive, it may end up with too many inputs discarded and the tests will not run.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To conclude with generators, let&#8217;s have a look to a sample of our Dutch customer with at least one account with negative balance:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>scala&gt; genDutchInRed.sample

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This shows us that maybe we should add some conditions to the accountId or the balance, because it is not normal to deal with such values in real life. This was for example one of the reasons to create <a href="https://47deg.github.io/scalacheck-datetime/">scalaCheck-datetime</a></p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_writing_tests">Writing tests</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that we are familiar with properties and generators, it is time to write tests. We have good examples in the Scala community, because ScalaCheck is used by many Scala open source projects (like Akka or Play).
In this case, we will continue with our concatenate example.</p>

 property("Concatenation length equal to length addition") = forAll { (s: String) =&gt;
 val len = s.length

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our properties file can be as simple as that, or we can make it as complicated as we need. We can also integrate it with <a href="http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/writing_scalacheck_style_properties">ScalaTest</a> or <a href="https://etorreborre.github.io/specs2/guide/SPECS2-3.0/org.specs2.guide.UseScalaCheck.html">Specs2</a></p>

<h2 id="_running_scalacheck_tests">Running ScalaCheck tests</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using sbt, we run ScalaCheck tests in the same way we run ScalaTest tests: sbt test:compile test. If our code is correct and all the tests generated by ScalaCheck are successful, we can see the following as output:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala">+ String Properties.Concatenation length equal to length addition: OK, passed 100 tests.

ScalaCheck
Passed: Total 2, Failed 0, Errors 0, Passed 2</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default, ScalaCheck generates 100 tests per property, which must be satisfied for the test to pass.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In case a property is not satisfied by the generated test data, ScalaCheck yields an error. And not only shows the input data which makes the property to fail, but it also simplifies as much as possible to show you the minimum value which makes the test to fail. This helps us a lot when going back to the code and applying a solution to fix the wrong implementation.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_how_scalacheck_helps_with_finding_bugs">How ScalaCheck helps with finding bugs</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are not yet convinced we&#8217;ll give you another example of code that looks fine at first glance, but will not meet the requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala">property("Absolute value should not be negative") = forAll { (input: Int) =&gt;
input.abs &gt;= 0
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Looks reasonable, if we apply abs to a number, we will get a positive one (or zero). But&#8230;&#8203; voilà! Here it is what ScalaCheck yields after running the test:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala">! String Properties.absolute value should not be negative: Falsified after 1 passed tests.
&gt; ARG_0: -2147483648
ScalaCheck
Failed: Total 1, Failed 1, Errors 0, Passed 0</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What ScalaCheck is showing is that the property fails for <code>input = -2147483648</code> Then, we realize that Int numbers are not symmetric <code>Int.MaxValue = 2147483647 Int.MinValue = -2147483648</code> So, when trying to apply abs to Int.MinValue, we get <code>Int.MinValue.abs = -2147483648</code> which does not satisfy the condition of <code>input.abs &gt;= 0.</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is very likely that we write our code without thinking about these kind of corner cases, because we probably never expect an input with <code>value -2147483648</code> But <code>since -2147483648</code> is valid input our code will accept it and will crash if we do not add conditions to prevent it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ScalaCheck focuses mainly on corner cases, where our functions are more sensible to fail. So for Int values, it will first test with MIN_VALUE, MAX_VALUE and 0; for String values will test with symbols and non-roman alphabet.</p>

<h2 id="_summary">Summary</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you feel you are adding many tests based on input data, stop for a moment and think twice about the possibility of translating the functionality into a property that ScalaCheck can test for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we can write properties for a given function, ScalaCheck provides an easy and very intuitive way of writing tests, which automatically generate large amounts of data for us, mainly focusing on corner and special cases.It is very helpful that ScalaCheck shrinks test cases to the minimal case.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ScalaCheck does NOT substitute ScalaTest or Specs2, but it complements them with property testing.Don&#8217;t forget that ScalaCheck is generating a finite number of tests, which means that there is always a chance that within this randomized set of tests, a bug might not be found (although it does exist in your code). However in case your input type is more constrained e.g. Byte, it can even generate all possible input data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I started with ScalaCheck soon after I started with Scala and it changed the way I look at tests. Be always open to explore and try new options, because from all of them you will always learn something useful.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://rnduja.github.io/2016/01/19/a_shapeless_primer/">Α shapeless primer</a> blog post by <a href="https://twitter.com/evacchi">Edoardo Vacchi</a> is the best and most complete introductory blog post I could find. It really goes into a lot of explaining hlists, product types, Generic[T], FnToProduct[F] object, implicit value resolution, evidences and typeclasses, the Aux Pattern). There is also a <a href="https://rnduja.github.io/2015/10/07/scala-dependent-types/">video</a> presentation by the author Edoardo Vacchi <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/evacchi/be-like-water-scala-italy-2016">(with slides)</a>. In this blog post I find very interesting the comparison of Scala with Prolog and how implicit variables, implicit functions, type parameters in functions and implicit parameter lists of functions can be “interpreted” in a rule-based context.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKaCCYZYBWo">Shapeless? - Easy!</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/valentinkasas">Valentin Kasas</a> explains in a great way an advanced example of a real life use case (computing deltas) (with <a href="https://twitter.com/valentinkasas">slides</a>). From this presentation I took the following <a href="http://harrylaou.com/scala/shapeless/deltas/">notes</a>. There are also available two nice blog posts by Valentin : Shapeless : not a tutorial - <a href="http://kanaka.io/blog/2015/11/09/shapeless-not-a-tutorial-part-1.html">part 1</a> (Heterogenous lists, polymorphic function values, high order poly functions) and part 2 (Generic, singleton types, records and LabelledGeneric)</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In First-class polymorphic function values in shapeless (2 of 3) — Natural Transformations in Scala, <a href="https://twitter.com/milessabin">Miles Sabin</a> the creator of <a href="https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless">shapeless</a> explains the concepts of polymorphic functions and natural transformations.</p>

<p>The page <a href="https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless/wiki/Feature-overview:-shapeless-2.0.0">Shapeless features</a> provides a short overview of the main features of the library : polymorphic function values, heterogenous lists, HList-style operations on standard Scala tuples, facilities for abstracting over arity, heterogenous maps, singleton-typed literals, singleton-typed symbols, extensible records, coproducts and discriminated unions, generic representation of (sealed families of) case classes, boilerplate-free lenses for arbitrary case classes, automatic type class instance derivation, first class lazy values tie implicit recursive knots, collections with statically known sizes, type safe cast(Typeable/TypeCase), testing for non-compilation (illTyped)</p>

<p>After reading Shapeless features , the natural thing to follow is the <a href="https://www.scala-exercises.org/shapeless/polymorphic_function_values">Scala exercises in shapeless</a> by 47 deg, which is almost identical to <a href="https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless/wiki/Feature-overview:-shapeless-2.0.0">Shapeless features</a>, but you will need to fill in the gaps so as to solve the exercises.</p>

<p>Last week, I started talking about the main things I&#8217;ve faced when learning Scala, after being a Java developers for a few years. Today, I will talk about how it was to move from Spain to the Netherlands, in order to join Lunatech.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Food. Oh boy, the food. Spain is known for its Iberian ham, and you have a lot of different hams on every supermarket you visit. Usually, there is a big fridge, full of brands of ham, and also meat: pork, chicken, beef. And beef is also classified depending on the part of the animal it comes from, there are more than 10 possible kinds of beef and I don&#8217;t even know which one to choose when I go to buy something.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I arrived to a dutch supermarket for the first time (Albert Heijn), I was surprised: there weren&#8217;t so many types of ham to choose, and most of the beef meat was ground meat, not slices. But, this supermarket shared one thing with the Spanish ones&#8230;&#8203; the big fridge. This time, the fridge was full of cheese.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve never seen so many different types of cheese in my life. On Spanish supermarkets, you usually find like 5 or 6 different cheese to choose about. But here, I&#8217;ve never seen less than 20 different cheeses on every supermarket I&#8217;ve visited so far. There is also cheese with spices! Never seen that before.Main differences between spanish and dutch gastronomy</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about the weather. When I was still doing Skype interviews with the people from Lunatech before joining them, everybody made the same joke: "why do you want to come to the Netherlands? Because of the weather?" And they laughed afterwards. I didn&#8217;t understood why.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My parents were also confused: "why do you want to move to the Netherlands? Most of the people from Europe comes to Spain because of the sun and the beach, and now you are moving to a country that is well known for its rain and wind". I was sure of my decision, I always thought that Spain was too hot for me, too dry, and the weather from the Netherlands would fit me more, with more rain and more clouds. I was so wrong.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first week I spent here, it rained every single day. Dutch weather welcomes foreigners by making them real men, under the rain. I wasn&#8217;t prepared for that. In Spain (not in the northern regions), when we say "rain" we are usually talking about some water falling over your shoulders and walking over wet floor. A standard dutch rain would be something to tell on the news if it happened on Spain. And I even remember the day some trains got delayed because of floods. In July, in summer. In Madrid (the city where I come from) we barely have 3 or 4 days of rain between May and September.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And the worst part about the dutch rain is that is also very irregular. Usually in Spain if you have rain, you have rain the whole day, and if you have sun, the same. But then, you wake up in the Netherlands, ready to go to the office, you see the sun in the sky and then you choose to go with a T-shirt. Few hours later, when you are coming home, the sky is black, you are absolutely wet on the street and you are wondering why you didn&#8217;t picked the jacket that morning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I remember one conversation with one of my coworkers:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Him: “<em>Oh look, the sun! Maybe you should go to the beach today</em>”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Me: “<em>But there are some clouds on the sky…</em>"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Him: “<em>This is the best you can get</em>"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Main differences between spanish and dutch weather</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But there is something that I really love about the dutch culture, and I wasn&#8217;t expecting to: bikes. Bikes here are very easy to get, and the streets are prepared to be crossed by bike. In Madrid it&#8217;s almost impossible to use a bike because the streets are narrow most of the time, and the cars are going through, but here, almost every street as a bike path, so you can safely go everywhere.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can park your bike at the station (actually, everywhere, if you are brave enough), and a lot of the people use the bike to make small distances, like going to the supermarket. I mean, this is very important: the relief of being able to carry all your bags on the bike and park it in front of your house, is almost a blessing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But not everything is wonderful about bikes: because you are in the Netherlands, and the dutch weather wants you to become a "<em>real man</em>". Sometimes you are having a great moment on your bike, and then suddenly the strongest wind you could ever imagine decides to go exactly on the opposite direction you are going, testing if your legs are strong enough, and if your will can handle the situation. And when is not coming from the front, is coming from your side, and then you will fall to the ground if you are not experienced enough.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But you can become an expert biker too. And dutch people love to show how professional they are on this matter. You think you are strong because you can carry all your supermarket bags and still going fast enough? Look at this mother carrying their two children on the bike and passing you on the left. You think you are cool because you can handle the bike with one hand while scratching your head with the other one? I&#8217;ve seen many times people texting on their phones, with both hands, while turning the bike. I&#8217;ve so much to learn.</p>

<p>Sometime ago I came from Madrid to Rotterdam to join Lunatech’s international workforce. Apart from introducing me to Dutch summers (rain), this also gave me an opportunity to learn a new programming language: Scala.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since I finished university I’ve been working with Java and I really liked it, but Scala was something entirely new to me. In this post I’ll give my first view on Scala from a Java perspective.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many people say that Scala is like Java but without semicolons, but I disagree. It’s true that Scala doesn’t need semicolons, and that may save developers some time, but it’s just a minor feature. One of the things that really caught my eye when I started, is related to style: unlike Java developers, Scala developers like to put everything on the same line. Let’s consider the next piece of Java code:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">public Foo someMethod(Foo foo, Bar bar) {		Foo firstResult = foo.doSomething();		Bar secondResult = bar.doOtherThing();		Foo finalResult = doLastThing(firstResult, secondResult);		return finalResult;		}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We could have compressed that into something smaller, but usually Java developers love verbose stuff: to define variables with long names so everything looks clear and people can understand what’s happening on the code. On the other hand, a Scala developer would do something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">def someMethod(foo: Foo, bar : Bar) : Foo = 		doLastThing(foo.doSomething, bar.doOtherThing)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Basically, the main thing that me, as a Java developer, saw when reading Scala code is “try to put everything on the same line”, and that makes things a bit difficult to understand at the beginning. But in the end your Scala code ends being very small and powerful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another thing that stands out are Collections. When you are learning Collections in Java, most of the times you start with arrays (Foo[]) and later you probably move to ArrayList. Then, iterating over your Collection of choice is made with for/while loops most of the time, with some logic inside the curly brackets. But Scala&#8217;s Collection library is more powerful and easy to use than the one you have available in Java.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Recent versions of Java have implemented new libraries with similar tools as in Scala, but they have been developed a few years ago, and most of the times they require weird implementations of the Stream class. Scala, on its side, was created with this kind of tools in mind, so they are far more accessible and easy to understand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Scala, the map method (and the rest of their friends: flatMap, flatten, head, tail, filter, etc) makes iterating through Collections so easy and safe, that you even try to use it as much as you possibly can. You don&#8217;t have to worry about IndexOutOfBoundsException anymore. When you can transform this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">for (int i = 0; i &lt; intList.size(); i++) {		if (intList.get(i) % 2 == 0)			intList.set(i, intList.get(i) + 1)	}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Into this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala">intList.map(x =&gt; if (x % 2 == 0) x + 1 else x)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your fingers will be glad you that you&#8217;ve switched to Scala.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But the award of “most surprising thing for people that comes from Java” goes to… vals and immutable stuff!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most common way of implementing immutability in Java is by using final on the variables/objects you want to remain constant through your code. But the way Scala uses immutability is somehow different: you try to make every single variable immutable. If you declare an Int or a String, you go immutable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you&#8217;re learning Java, you are told to declare as few variables as possible, and to reuse them as much as possible, in order to release memory and make the life of the garbage collector easier. But in Scala, you have two options: you can either use var (mutable variable) or val (immutable variable), but you are told to use val as much as possible, and to avoid var as much as you can. At the beginning this is confusing (you wonder "if I should use always val, why do you allow me to use var on the first place?") and many times you want to hit you head against a wall. But when you start to master Collections and your inner-developer is at peace with the Immutability Zen, it&#8217;s even rewarding and interesting to make code with everything immutable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So I’m having fun learning Scala, and I will go with some more details next week about moving to the Netherlands.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_first_approach">First approach</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since scala 2.11 we can have case class with more than 22 fields, so the following compiles.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>case class JsonExample (    a1:String, a2:String, a3:String, a4:String, a5:String, a6:String,    a7:String, a8:String, a9:String, a10:String, a11:String, a12:String,    a13:String, a14:String, a15:String, a16:String, a17:String, a18:String,    a19:String, a20:String, a21:String, a22:String, a23:String, a24:String)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But if we try to use Play <a href="https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.5.x/ScalaJsonAutomated">JSON automated mapping</a></p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>import play.api.libs.json._implicit val jsonExampleFormat = Json.format[JsonExample]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>we get a compiler error</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead we can use <a href="https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.5.x/ScalaJsonCombinators">Play-Json extensions</a>(requires play-json &gt;= 2.4)</p>

<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So now we have a Play Json format for a case class with more than 22 fields, and can use it as described in <a href="https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.5.x/ScalaJsonCombinators">Play Json documentation</a></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_second_approach">Second approach</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I don’t consider having a case class with so many fields a good solution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A better solution is to organize these fields in “logical” embedded case classes.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>case class A (

)
case class C (
a17:String, a18:String, a19:String, a20:String,    a21:String, a22:String, a23:String, a24:String  )
case class JsonExample2 (
a : A,
b : B,
c : C
)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We use a “regular” play json format for the embedded case classes.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>import play.api.libs.json._
implicit val jsonAFormat : Format[A] = Json.format[A]
implicit val jsonBFormat : Format[B]= Json.format[B]
implicit val jsonCFormat : Format[C] = Json.format[C]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And the “trick” now is to use the JsPath <a href="https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.5.x/ScalaJsonCombinators">Play Json Combinator</a> for the embedded case classes without any path.</p>

<div class="listingblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Last week we talked about <a href="http://www.lunatech.com/blog/V5tpoCQAANsPL4jw/continuous-integration-on-gitlab-with-scala-and-sbt">Continuous Integration (CI) with Scala and SBT on GitLab</a>. This week we are going to take a step further and implement Continuous Delivery (CD) on GitLab with Play and Heroku.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s first recap last week’s post. To enable CI, we used the .gitlab-ci.yml file. Builds are run in Docker and to make sure we could execute our tests, we used a Java Docker image and made sure SBT was installed. The definition in our .gitlab-ci.yml file contained only a single stage: the test stage. This week we are going to extend our pipeline with a deploy stage.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_play_deployment_with_heroku">Play Deployment with Heroku</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The application we are going to deploy is a Play Framework application. For now we assume we already have such application with SBT as the build tool.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Heroku is a cloud application platform that has support for Play applications. This means that running your application on Heroku requires little setup and most important is getting the source of your application there. For that, we use the tool <a href="https://github.com/travis-ci/dpl">dpl</a> from Travis CI.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Dpl is a simple command line deployment tool that supports Heroku. We can deploy our Play application to Heroku using dpl with the following command:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>dpl --provider=heroku --app=&lt;application-name&gt; --api-key=&lt;api-key&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First you have to create an application in Heroku.<code>&lt;application-name&gt;</code> in the command above should be substituted with the name you gave the application. Additionally, <code>&lt;api-key&gt;</code> should be substituted by your Heroku API key which you can find under (under <a href="https://dashboard.heroku.com/account">Account</a> &gt; API Key).</p>

</div>

<h2 id="_putting_it_all_together">Putting It All Together</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With Continuous Integration (CI) we aim to be able to test the changes we make to our projects automatically and externally. An usual setup involves e.g. GitHub and Jenkins and requires quite some configuration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this post we look at an alternative approach using GitLab which offers both the features of the aforementioned services: git hosting and continuous integration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this post we specifically focus on Scala projects with SBT as the build tool. Let’s assume we have an SBT project that contains tests and is hosted on GitLab. Now we have to tell GitLab that we want CI. We do this by adding a <code>.gitlab-cy.yml</code> file in the root directory of our project.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_the_code_gitlab_ci_yml_code_file">The <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> File</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Builds are run in Docker and therefore we have to specify in the .gitlab-ci.yml file which Docker image we want to use. Additionally we define some commands before our tests are run. We use the Java 8 image and make sure SBT is installed and available in our builds:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml">image: java:8

before_script:
  # Enable the usage of sources over https
  - apt-get update -yqq
  - apt-get install apt-transport-https -yqq
  # Add keyserver for SBT
  - echo "deb http://dl.bintray.com/sbt/debian /" | tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt.list
  - apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 642AC823
  # Install SBT
  - apt-get update -yqq
  - apt-get install sbt -yqq
  # Log the sbt version
  - sbt sbt-version</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now let’s define the stages we want to use. We add the test stage with the following lines:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml">stages:
  - test</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At last, we define a job in the test stage that executes the the tests in our project:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml">test:
  stage: test
  script:
    # Execute your project's tests
    - sbt clean test</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Builds within the same stage run in parallel and the jobs in a next stage are started after all previous stages are successfully finished. We can define as much stages and builds as we want. Together, they are called a pipeline.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After we commit and push the <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file to GitLab, CI is enabled and the pipeline is executed on every new push to the project.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_measuring_test_coverage">Measuring Test Coverage</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To display the test coverage of our test job we need to take two steps:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Add test coverage measuring in our SBT project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instruct GitLab how to extract the coverage percentage from the build trace.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We measure test coverage by using the SBT plugin sbt-scoverage. Add the following line to <code>/project/plugins.sbt</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml">addSbtPlugin("org.scoverage" % "sbt-scoverage" % "1.3.5")</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can now measure test coverage with sbt clean coverage test coverageReport. We change this in <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml">test:
  stage: test
  script:
    # Execute your project's tests and measure test coverage
    - sbt clean coverage test coverageReport</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And in our project settings under CI/CD pipelines &gt; Test coverage parsing we add the following regular expression: Coverage was <code>\[\d+.\d+\%\]</code>. This enables GitLab to extract the coverage percentage from a build trace and display it next the the build results.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Recursion is beautiful. As an example, let&#8217;s consider this perfectly acceptable example of defining the functions <code>even</code> and <code>odd</code> in Scala, whose semantics you can guess:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala">def even(i: Int): Boolean = i match {
  case 0 =&gt; true
  case _ =&gt; odd(i - 1)
}

def odd(i: Int): Boolean = i match {
  case 0 =&gt; false
  case _ =&gt; even(i - 1)
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve defined even in a very natural way: an value is <code>even</code> when it&#8217;s zero, or when it&#8217;s <code>odd</code> after subtracting one. <code>Odd</code> is defined in a similar way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s ignore the problem this code has with negative integers, and the fact that an <code>O(n)</code> algorithm for computing <code>even</code> and <code>odd</code> is not ideal, and focus on a single problem: this code breaks for large n:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>scala&gt; even(5000)
res3: Boolean = true
scala&gt; even(50000)

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the remainder of this post we look at various strategies for preventing recursive programs from running out of memory.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_but_what_s_the_problem">But what&#8217;s the problem?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem manifests itself in the stack trace: even calls <code>odd</code>, then <code>odd</code> calls <code>even</code>, which calls <code>odd</code> again. Each of these invocations causes the creation of a stack frame, eating away the space that&#8217;s reserved for them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keeping all the stack frames would not really be necessary: when <code>even</code> calls <code>odd</code>, that is the very last thing that the even function will ever do! When <code>odd</code> returns, <code>even</code> itself returns immediately with that same value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we compute <code>even(500)</code>, after a bunch of recursive calls, the 501st stack frame will be created, for the invocation of <code>even(0)</code>, which returns true, and the 500 method calls that are left on the stack will one after another all return that same value, until the whole stack is unwinded.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some languages or runtimes are smart enough to figure out that if a calling function will simply return the value that a function it calls returns, it does not need to allocate a new stack frame for the callee, but can reuse the stack frame of the caller for that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately, the JVM does not support this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And so Scala, as long as it sticks to JVM method calling semantics, also can not support this.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_a_bit_of_light_at_the_end_of_the_tunnel">A bit of light at the end of the tunnel</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Luckily, there is one special case of tail calls which Scala treats differently, and that is the case of tail recursion. If a method does a tail call to itself, it&#8217;s called tail recursion, and Scala will rewrite the recursion into a loop that does not consume stack space.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many recursive algorithms can be rewritten in a tail recursive way. For our even and odd problem, this is a possible solution:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala">def even(i: Int): Boolean = i match {
case 0 =&gt; true
case 1 =&gt; false
case _ =&gt; even(i - 2)
}
def odd(i: Int): Boolean = !even(i)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve rewritten <code>even</code> to be tail-recursive, and now Scala will optimize it for us:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>scala&gt; even(500000000)
res25: Boolean = true</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>it no longer blows up for large numbers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>@tailrec</code> annotation is useful in these cases. It does not change how the function will be compiled, but it does trigger an error if the function is not actually tail-recursive. So this will protect you from accidentally changing a function that you want to be tail-recursive function into something that&#8217;s no longer tail recursive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can try this out by putting the <code>@tailrec</code> annotation on the first and the latest version of even that we&#8217;ve defined.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_trampolines">Trampolines</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another way of solving the problem of consuming too much stack space, is by moving the computation from the stack to the heap.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead of letting the even function recursively call odd, we could also let it return some recipe to it&#8217;s caller, how to continue with the computation. Let&#8217;s look at the following code:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala">sealed trait EvenOdd

case class Done(result: Boolean) extends EvenOdd
case class Even(value: Int) extends EvenOdd
case class Odd(value: Int) extends EvenOdd

def even(i: Int): EvenOdd = i match {
  case 0 =&gt; Done(true)
  case _ =&gt; Odd(i - 1)
}

def odd(i: Int): EvenOdd = i match {
  case 0 =&gt; Done(false)
  case _ =&gt; Even(i - 1)
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here we defined a little language, EvenOdd, that can express three things:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The computation is Done, and we have the result value</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to compute whether a value is Even</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to compute whether a value is Odd</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our even and odd functions no longer return a boolean, but return an expression in this little language.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, we create an interpreter, that will recursively evaluate expressions in this language:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala">// Using Scala's self recursive tail call optimization
@tailrec
def run(evenOdd: EvenOdd): Boolean = evenOdd match {
  case Done(result) =&gt; result
  case Even(value) =&gt; run(even(value))
  case Odd(value) =&gt; run(odd(value))
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now we have expressed <code>even</code> and <code>odd</code> in their natural, mutually recursive way, and we still have a stack safe interpreter:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>scala&gt; run(even(5000000))
res1: Boolean = true</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The disadvantage of this is that this is significantly slower. Unfortunately, we can&#8217;t seem to have our cake and eat it too :(</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This strategy is sometimes called trampolining, because instead of creating a big stack, we go up to <code>even</code>, then down to run, then up to <code>odd</code>, then down to run, then up to <code>even</code>, down to run, etcetera. The size of our stack keeps growing and shrinking by one frame for every step in the computation. This looks a lot like going up and down on a trampoline :)</p>

<h2 id="_generalizing">Generalizing</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is no need to specialize our little language to computing <code>even</code> and <code>odd</code>. We can also make a little language that can express recursion in a general way:</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that our run function is no longer tied to computing <code>even</code> and <code>odd</code>, it can compute anything.</p>

<p><strong>Ray Kemp</strong> and <strong>Nicolas Leroux</strong>, jointly CEO, have successfully realized a management buy-out (“MBO”) of Lunatech Labs BV (“Lunatech”). Also, some staff members acquired a small stake in the company in this transaction. Lunatech is a Dutch IT service provider specialised in system integration, customised software implementation and web applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Main Corporate Finance has structured the MBO and arranged the debt financing. Bank financing has been provided by Rabobank. The transaction was partly financed with a mezzanine loan provided by Main Mezzanine Capital.Lunatech stands out in linking and structuring applications between back-end and front-end. Lunatech provides support for complex IT system integration and migration projects and they support IT departments of organisations. The company offers high quality solutions including consultancy and supplying project teams of Scala professionals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lunatech was founded in 1993 and located in Rotterdam. Lunatech provides its services to proven customers in the Netherlands and France, as for example: ING, SDU, Alcatel, Disney and UPS.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The strength of Lunatech is also recognised by the investors, says Lars van ‘t Hoenderdaal:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“<em>Lunatech is a very nice company with a strong management team and international growth potential. We experienced great interest among our funders to participate in this mezzanine proposition</em>.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After reaching agreement on the transaction structure and financing structure, the transaction has been completed within 4 weeks. Rabobank has also shown their strength by acting quickly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ray Kemp, CEO Lunatech, is very satisfied with the realised MBO:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>“Due to funding from the bank and mezzanine we were able to realise the MBO without a private equity investor. In this way we can realise our growth independently</em>.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Main Mezzanine Capital is part of Main Capital Partners, an investment and financing company, as well as a corporate finance advisor, with a focus on growing and profitable companies in the TMT sector in the Netherlands.

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For all three approaches we’ll use the same use case: find a <code>User</code> object by its ‘username’ property.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_java_persistence_api_query_language">Java Persistence API query language</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An easy way to read data from our database is by creating a ‘dynamic query’ with use of the Java Persistance API (JPA) query language, a string-based query language. To find a <code>User</code> by username we would write something like:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">try {
    return JPA.em()
        .createQuery("from User where username = :username", User.class)
        .setParameter("username", "foo").getSingleResult();
} catch (NoResultException nre) {
    return null;
} catch (NonUniqueResultException nure) {
    return null;
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem with this example is syntax checking. The query language is not checked at compile time, so if we write <code>from Uzer</code> instead of <code>from User</code> no compile-time errors will occur. However, because the query is incorrect, we &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; get a runtime error. To prevent these kind of runtime errors we need a way to create syntactically checked queries. This is where the JPA Criteria API comes in.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_jpa_criteria_api">JPA Criteria API</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Criteria API is an alternative to the query language. It allows us to define object-based queries instead of the string-based approach of the query language. The advantage is that these object-based queries are more syntactically checked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we want to find the <code>User</code> with help of the Criteria API it becomes this piece of code:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">try {
    CriteriaBuilder cb = JPA.em().getCriteriaBuilder();
    CriteriaQuery&lt;User&gt; query = cb.createQuery(User.class);
    Root&lt;User&gt; user = query.from(User.class);
    query.where(cb.equal(user.get("username"), "foo"));
    return JPA.em().createQuery(query).getSingleResult();
} catch (NoResultException nre) {
    return null;
} catch (NonUniqueResultException nure) {
    return null;
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here the compiler will give us an error if we write <code>Uzer.class</code> instead of <code>User.class</code>. So more syntax checking. But as you probably already noticed, <code>user.get("username")</code> is still not checked for correct syntax. Our code will successfully compile if we replace <code>username</code> with <code>uzrname</code>. This is because the compiler doesn’t know if <code>uzrname</code> is a property of the <code>User</code> class. So we need more syntax checking to prevent these kind of errors. With the help of Java Persistence Metamodel API we can create fully syntactically checked queries.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_jpa_2_0_metamodels">JPA 2.0 Metamodels</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A metamodel class is a class that represents the datastructure of the corresponding model class. For example, this model class:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">@Entity
public class User {
    public Long id;
    public String username;
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Would have the following metamodel class:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">@StaticMetamodel(User.class)
public abstract class User_ {
    public static volatile SingularAttribute&lt;User, String&gt; username;
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now we are able to create a type-safe query:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">try {
    CriteriaBuilder cb = JPA.em().getCriteriaBuilder();
    CriteriaQuery&amp;lt;User&amp;gt; query = cb.createQuery(User.class);
    Root&amp;lt;User&amp;gt; user = query.from(User.class);
    query.where(cb.equal(user.get(User_.username), "foo"));
    return JPA.em().createQuery(query).getSingleResult();
} catch (NoResultException nre) {
    return null;
} catch (NonUniqueResultException nure) {
    return null;
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These metamodels are pretty useful because our queries are syntactically correct and type-safe&#33; Syntactically correct because all the syntax is checked. We will get an error is we replace <code>username</code> by <code>uzername</code>. So if we, for example, rename a variable, the compiler will tell us which queries we forgot to update. We won’t get a runtime error.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The query is also type-safe. Type safety means that the compiler will validate types while compiling. If a wrong type is assigned to a variable an exception is thrown at compile time. As you probably know Play 2.0 is [focused on type safety](<a href="http://www.playframework.org/documentation/2.0/Philosophy" class="bare">http://www.playframework.org/documentation/2.0/Philosophy</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because of the metamodels, the compiler knows the type of the variables. So you can’t for example do:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">try {
    CriteriaBuilder cb = JPA.em().getCriteriaBuilder();
    CriteriaQuery&amp;lt;User&amp;gt; query = cb.createQuery(User.class);
    Root&amp;lt;User&amp;gt; user = query.from(User.class);
    query.like(cb.like(user.get(User_.id), "1"));
    return JPA.em().createQuery(query).getSingleResult();
} catch (NoResultException nre) {
    return null;
} catch (NonUniqueResultException nure) {
    return null;
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This query won’t compile because the <code>like</code> method needs a <code>Expression&lt;String&gt;</code> as first parameter and <code>id</code> is a <code>Expression&lt;Long&gt;</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because it takes some time to write these metamodels by hand, it would be nicer to generate them. The next paragraph will explain how to generate metamodels in Play 2.0.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_jpa_2_0_metamodel_genaration_in_play_2_0">JPA 2.0 Metamodel genaration in Play 2.0</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A way to generate our metamodels is by using the <code>org.hibernate.jpamodelgen.JPAMetaModelEntityProcessor</code>. The processor will automatically run if the hibernate-jpamodelgen.jar is added to the classpath and when you are using JDK 6. So we add a project dependecy to our Build.scala:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">val appDependencies = Seq(
    "org.hibernate" % "hibernate-jpamodelgen" % "1.2.0.Final"
)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And specify a folder where the generated source files are placed. This is done by passing an argument to the Java compiler. Passing an argument is also done in Build.scala:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">val main = PlayProject(appName, appVersion, appDependencies, mainLang = JAVA).settings(
    javacOptions ++= Seq("-s", "metamodel")
)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that the provided folder must exist, the Java compiler won’t generate it for you. So it is probably not a good idea to put the metamodels in our target folder, because its contents are deleted when the the <code>play clean</code> command is run.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Eclipse users can add the metamodel folder to their ‘source folders’ (Project → Properties → Java Build Path → Source → Add Folder) for autocompletion etc.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using the Criteria API with metamodels gives us the opportunity to write syntactically correct and type-safe queries. It is also quite easy to generate these metamodels. So with a bit of effort we can get nice object-based, syntactically correct and type-safe queries that cause fewer runtime errors.</p>
